## Deep network visibility, powered by Suricata.

Artica integrates the Suricata IDS engine directly inside your server, giving you enterprise-grade intrusion detection without the complexity.

Monitor every packet in real time, detect advanced threats, and visualize malicious traffic patterns as they happen — all from the comfort of your Artica console.

Whether it’s malware, C2 traffic, or zero-day exploitation attempts, Suricata continuously inspects and correlates flows to keep your network one step ahead.

**Combined with Artica’s automation and reporting tools, you get powerful, AI-ready network intelligence that turns raw packets into actionable security insights**

This engine is a service managed through the **[Artica Web Console](https://github.com/dtouzeau/Artica-v4.50)**
).
# Installation
It’s built directly into Artica Appliances and **[ISO images](https://artica.systems/)**, which you can download from https://artica.systems/

These Debian-based ISO images (10, 12, 13) include the Suricata 8.x engine (and soon 9.x). They let you install a complete system on a virtual or physical machine, with full Linux and Suricata management through a web interface. 

The installed system is open, and you can access it via Unix console or SSH.
