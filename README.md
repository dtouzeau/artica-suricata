## Deep network visibility, powered by Suricata.

Artica integrates the Suricata IDS engine directly inside your server, giving you enterprise-grade intrusion detection without the complexity.

Monitor every packet in real time, detect advanced threats, and visualize malicious traffic patterns as they happen — all from the comfort of your Artica console.

Whether it’s malware, C2 traffic, or zero-day exploitation attempts, Suricata continuously inspects and correlates flows to keep your network one step ahead.

**Combined with Artica’s automation and reporting tools, you get powerful, AI-ready network intelligence that turns raw packets into actionable security insights**

This engine is a service managed through the **[Artica Web Console](https://github.com/dtouzeau/Artica-v4.50)**
).
It’s built directly into Artica Appliances and **ISO images**, which you can download from https://artica.systems/
